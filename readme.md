# CLI tools for Linux

Over time I will keep adding more programs for you :P

## Excel
Ever needed to convert from .ods to .xlsx? Well I did, and made a program for it that works seamlessly in the Linux terminal.
You will need to have soffice (LibreOffice) installed and added to your PATH to make this work.

### Installation
1) Download the `excel` file from this repository
2) Make it executable `chmod +x excel`
3) Put it into a directory that is in your PATH.
4) Done.

### Usage
1) CD into a directory with the .ods files
2) Type `excel` into the terminal
3) Done. All files have been converted to a MS Excel format.
